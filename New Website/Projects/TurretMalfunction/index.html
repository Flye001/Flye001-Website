            <h1>Turret Malfunction</h1>
            <p>Turret Malfunction is a browser game I made for the 2020 GMTK Game Jam during lockdown, in collaboration
                with <a href="https://adamwhitto.me/" target="_blank">Adam</a>.</p>
            <p>We created it using Unity, and all the art was designed by Adam.</p>

            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>In a dystopian future, you operate one of the many city defense turrets, to protect your city from the
                Zombies.</p>
            <p>However, your turret has malfunctioned, gone out of control, and with the zombies approaching fast, you
                have no escape - you must make the most of a bad situation and continue to operate your out of control
                turret.</p>

            <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
            <p>The premise is simple, shoot the zombies before they reach you. However, you cannot control your turret's
                direction, it just keeps spinning. Furthermore, you only get one bullet at a time, adding an extra level
                of challenge to the game. Every wave (10 points), the speed of the zombies gradually increases.</p>

            <h2>Play</h2>
