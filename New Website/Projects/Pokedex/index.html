            <h1>Pokedex</h1>
            <h2>The Original Pokedex</h2>
            <p>In June 2016, I embarked on my first ever real journey into development. At the age of 12, I decided to make a real life Pokedex, powered by a Raspberry Pi.</p>
            <p>It began as a text only program which simply told you a Pokemon's name after entering in their ID. I bought a keypad, a few buttons and LEDs, and 2 small screens, to connect to the Raspberry Pi. You could enter a Pokemon ID with the keypad and then it would display a picture of that Pokemon on the big screen, with some information on the small screen.</p>
            <p>I also decided to buy a Raspberry Pi camera, which I used to take a photo and then overlay a chosen Pokemon on top of the picture. It would then email this picture to me.</p>
            <p>We were then able to go to a local maker space and get a case we designed laser cut.</p>
            <p>The final product ended up looking like this:</p>

            <p>In September 2016 I was fortunate enough to be able to show this off at Cambridge Univeristy at the Cambridge Raspberry Jam, where I gave a 5 minute presentation about it.</p>

            <h2>Pokedex V2</h2>
            <p>The next year, I wanted to re-make this project with the knowledge I had gained over that year. I decided to make the new version run on a single touchscreen in a much smaller, cleaner case. This time, the case was 3D printed, and it just had a single touchscreen display, with a camera mounted in the back.</p>
            <p>The UI was completely reworked to accommodate the touchscreen, and I was again pleased with the end result. It had all the same features as the first Pokedex, however this time, much smaller and portable.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, I cannot find a picture of it working, and at the time of writing, it no longer boots up for some reason, however below is a picture of it turned off.</p>
