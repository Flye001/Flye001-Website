            <h1>FlyeWords</h1>
            <p>FlyeWords is a simple word game influenced by the popular game Wordle.</p>
            <p>I made FlyeWords to try and improve my HTML/CSS skills, as up until then, I hadn't really designed anything myself, I'd always just work on the backend side of things.</p>
            <p>The project was originally created with Vue.JS, however I recreated it using Blazor to allow the option of using SignalR for a multiplayer version in the future.</p>
            <p>You can access FlyeWords here:</p>
